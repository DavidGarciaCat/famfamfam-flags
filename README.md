About
----------

The `Flags` icon pack, as available on [famfamfam website](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/flags/).

All credits for these icons go to their original author: mjames@gmail.com

The aim of this project is to make this icon pack available through various package managers, such as:

- [NPM](https://npmjs.org)
- [Bower](http://bower.io)
- [Packagist](https://packagist.org)


All icons are supplied in both PNG and GIF formats.


CSS spritesheets
----------

You can insert the icons directly into your HTML with a common IMG tag:

```
    <img alt="French Flag" src="dist/png/fr.png" width="16" height="11">
```


In addition to the icons by themselves, this project also ships a CSS spritesheet for the icon-pack. Those spritesheet allows to load the entire icon-pack in just 1 image, and thus reduce HTTP calls.

All the positioning of the icons inside this alone image is made through CSS, which allows you to just add block-type tags with the proper class and get the same result:

```
    <div class="famfamfam-flags fr"></div>
```
